<h1>Homework 8</h1>
<h2>Mac Jacobs</h2>
<h3>The question I chose to focus on was; what portion of North Carolina roads are intersecting with the coastline?  In order to answer this question I used the geoprocessing tools buffer and intersect.  I used the buffer tool to create a buffered coastline that displayed the coast of north carolina.  I then gathered data from the census to find all the major and minor roads and then used the intersect tool to only gather the data from roads in north carolina.  I was then able to answer the question of what portion of raods are intsersecting with the coastline and from the map it appears that the majority of the coastline intersects with some road.  This was interesting to see because it may cause problems in the future if/when the coastline starts to move inward which could cause the government to restructure many roads in north carolina.  </h3>
